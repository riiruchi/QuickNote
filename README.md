# QuickNote

QuickNote is an iOS note-taking application that allows users to create and manage notes with various features. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to jot down their thoughts, create checklists, and format text.

## Features

- **Add Notes**: Users can create and save notes with titles and body text.
- **Add Checklists**: QuickNote supports adding checklists to notes, allowing users to create lists of items with checkboxes.
- **Text Formatting**: Users can format text within their notes by applying bold and italic styles.
- **Core Data Storage**: All notes are stored locally using Core Data, ensuring data persistence across app sessions.

## Architecture

QuickNote is built following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. This architecture separates the application logic into three components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. In QuickNote, the `QuickNote` entity and Core Data operations encapsulate the model layer.
  
- **View**: Represents the user interface components. Views in QuickNote display the notes and allow users to interact with them.
  
- **ViewModel**: Acts as an intermediary between the view and the model. ViewModels in QuickNote handle user interactions, perform business logic, and provide data to the views.

## Clean and Reusable Code

QuickNote emphasizes clean and reusable code practices to enhance maintainability and scalability. By adhering to coding standards and modularizing components, developers can easily understand and extend the functionality of the application.

## Usage

To use QuickNote, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
